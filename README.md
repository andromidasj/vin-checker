# VIN Checker

This simple tool was created for Hydro One Networks Inc. in Ontario, Canada.

Simply paste in the VINs you'd like to check, and the tool will pull results from from [DriveON](https://driveonportal.com/ONPublicWeb/en/#/vehicleSearchScreen) API. From there, you can browse the results in the table provided on the site, or simply click the button to copy the results to your clipboard, where they can be pasted into your spreadsheet editor of choice for further analysis.

This tool is deployed on https://vin-checker.vercel.app/.
